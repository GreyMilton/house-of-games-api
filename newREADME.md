# Grey's House of Games API

## What is this repo?

This is a repo that I (Grey Milton) created for a *portfolio project* as part of the Northcoders Full-Stack JavaScript Bootcamp (20 Sep 2021 cohort).

It is the bones of a new API that mimicks a real world backend service (such as reddit), which could then provide information for further front end architecture (although doesn't at the present time).

## Link to the hosted version:

I have hosted a version on Heroku. You can [interact with it here](`insert link here`)

## What does this API do?

It accesses, creates, modifies, and deletes data relating to an online board games review site.

The data is contained in four PSQL tables: `categories`, `users`, `reviews` and `comments`.

### Categories

### Users

### Reviews

### Comments

A users interaction with the API is by the http methods:
 *GET
 *POST
 *PATCH
 *DELETE
